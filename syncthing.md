By default, Syncthing will not autostart unless you explicitly enable it. On Arch Linux (or any systemd-based distro), you need to enable the systemd service so it runs automatically at boot.

Hereâ€™s what you should do:

âœ… Step-by-step (for your user account):
Enable Syncthing for your user (so it starts only when you log in):

bash
Copy
Edit
systemctl --user enable syncthing.service
Start it right now (if you want to test immediately):

bash
Copy
Edit
systemctl --user start syncthing.service
ðŸ”’ Optional but important:
Make sure to allow Syncthing through your firewall if you have one (like ufw, firewalld, etc.), especially for local device discovery and web UI access.

ðŸ§  Pro tip (if you want system-wide setup instead):
If you want Syncthing to run for all users or even without login, you can use:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl enable syncthing@yourusername.service
